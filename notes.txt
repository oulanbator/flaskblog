>>>>> Step 11 - Blueprints and configuration

>>> Blueprints :
(Split up the different application fonctionalities into their own sections)

- Create new package in our application named after the functions it contains
exp : users, posts, main
- Create __init.py__ file in each folder
- Each folder should contain its own routes.py, forms.py, utils.py, if needed

>> ROUTES
- Put the routes in the right package (everything related to users f.ex)
- We don't use the global "app" anymore to define the routes. Change the routes from @app.route() to @users.route()
- Do the same for posts, and main routes

>> FORMS
- Put all the forms related to users in its own "forms.py"

>> IMPORTS
- Put all the imports needed in the right files
- Fix the imports where some changes are needed

>> Delete old files (forms.py and routes.py)




>>> Application factory : 
(Creation of the app in a function (usefull if we want an app for development and another for production))
