# Flask-Blog

My first Flask project/tutorial. This Flask app serves an full featured Blog. It is still very simple, and the focus were not the design or functionalities, but learning how Flask library works

* Login and authentification implemented
* User account page to modify informations
* E-mail password recovery
* Post messages and modify your posts 
* SQLite database managed in the back with SQLAlchemy ORM.

# Minimal Setup Example

To build some examples locally, clone this repository :
> git clone https://github.com/oulanbator/flaskblog

Then install requirements.txt and run the app

That's it !
